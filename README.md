# RAGnarok

**RAGnarok** is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that:
- Accepts PDFs (and optionally images)
- Responds using these files as its knowledge base
- Falls back to regular LLM answers when info isn't in the files
- Runs locally first, and is scalable to the web
- Is fully dockerised

## Features
- Upload PDFs/images for knowledge ingestion
- Ask questions and get answers based on uploaded files
- LLM fallback for answers outside file knowledge
- REST API (Flask) + React web UI
- Dockerised for easy deployment
- Uses Postgres for metadata storage

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Frontend:** React
- **Database:** Postgres
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install Docker & Docker Compose
3. Build and run all services (the first run will download required Docker images):

```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

- The first time you run this command, Docker will automatically download the necessary images for Python, Node, and Postgres.
- Subsequent runs will use the cached images unless you change the Dockerfiles or dependencies.

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`  
Backend API at `http://localhost:5000`
